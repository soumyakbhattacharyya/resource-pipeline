#### **1.2 Objectives**
- Provide a structured framework for managing resources across multiple projects.
- Enable organizations to forecast resource availability and capacity.
- Ensure accurate project costing based on actual resource utilization.
- Prevent resource overbooking and conflicts across projects.

#### **1.3 Target Users**
- **Project Managers** – Plan and allocate skilled resources to projects.
- **Resource Managers** – Manage the resource pool, track availability, and forecast capacity.
- **Finance & Operations Teams** – Estimate project costs based on actual resource utilization.
